### Minimum Viable Product

Distraction-free document editor that integrates with Google Documents. Mobile support as a secondary concern.

Pre-login page:
 * Title
 * Short description
 * Login button (connect to Google account)

Design concepts:
 * Designed to be run full screen with nothing but background and text visible.
 * Minimal display of elements.
 * Assuming default browser support for cut, copy, paste, undo, redo.
 * Complex formatting left for Google Documents.
 * Prefer to have font color only local to app. Retain black text in saved document.

Cursor movement will reveal:
 * Document Options
  * New
  * Open
  * Save (Supports Google Documents autosave?)
  * Hide/view title
 * Text Options
  * Bold
  * Italic
  * Underline
  * Font
  * Color
  * Size
 * Environment Options
  * Background Image
  * Background Alpha
  * Background Color
  * Typing Sound
